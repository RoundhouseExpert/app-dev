## **Series Name:** Frieren - Beyond Journey's End
### **Description**
Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a new anime series, animated by the studio MadHouse this September of 2023. It is basically a fantasy story about an elf named Frieren who lives a very long life, retelling her past adventures when she was in a party to defeat the Demon King, while living her current life as a master of an apprentice mage, adventuring wherever she wants. The story of the series emphasizes on both her past and current life, trying to tie them together in order to create a very meaningful story that showcases the depth of character development that the show creates. Currently, the show is one of the most watched and liked shows in this season, making it an unexpected sleeper hit among most people, including me. The show is very calm and atmospheric, showcasing aesthetics that are meant for enjoyers of old fantasy like Lord of The Rings. In fact, I could argue that Frieren itself is an animated homage to Lord of The Rings mixed with the appeal of modern anime tropes. The animation is also very superb, as expected of MadHouse's assurance to animation quality, wherein movements of each characters feels real and just amazing to look at, especially the rare fight scenes that the anime offers. Overall, if one is an enjoyer of old fantasy and calming anime, then this show is for them.

| Fern | The current apprentice of Frieren in the present time. A very stoic and non-chalant mage, she was a victim of war that killed her family, living her in the world. She was saved by one of Frieren's old party member, the priest Heiter. Heiter asked Frieren to train her, which she did. After Heiter's death, Fern became Frieren's partner in adventuring, and the two of them roam the lands in search for magical tomes, for training, or just helping people out. | ![Fern](https://letsotaku.com/upload//upload/news/666192134942.webp)|
| Stark | Another party member of Frieren's current life. Stark was the apprentice of Frieren's former party member, the legendary warrior Eisen. Stark was initially a coward who couldn't fight for his life, but has a potential to be very strong, even more so than his master. After a fight with a dragon, he gained the courage that he needed, and joined Frieren's small party in adventuring. | ![Stark](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/stark-in-frieren.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=943&h=&dpr=1.5)|
| Himmel | The hero of the lands, and the slayer of the Demon King. He was the leader of the party that Frieren was previously a part of. Kind-hearted and truly has the heart of a hero, he will do anything to save the people from the threat of demonkind to mankind. He also is a dear friend to Frieren, where most Frieren's current attitude actually came from Himmel. Lastly, despite being a hero, he is kind of full of himself sometimes, especially when statues are made to honor him. | ![Himmel](https://top-rankings-japan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Himmel-from-Frieren-Beyond-Journeys-End.jpg)|
| Heiter | The priest of the hero group, Heiter is someone who'd you think wouldn't be a priest. He is very materialistic and likes to drink, which is something that priests shouldn't actually do. Despite all of this, he has a heart of gold, helping people whenever he can, and giving advice to them. He was very attached to Frieren, to the point of him knowing all of her antics and seeing through her. He saved Fern when she was a child, and eventually was the middlemen and making her the apprentice of Frieren. | ![Heiter](https://fictionhorizon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Heiter.jpg)|
| Eisen | The warrior of the hero's party. He has a straightforward personality, and mostly is quiet in the group, but becomes active whenever there are shenanigans to be had, especially with Heiter. He trained Stark after his retirement from adventuring, wherein both of them enjoyed eachother's companies until a particular incident had happened. He gives the current Frieren advice when it comes to her journey, and helps her whenever he can. | ![Eisen](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/10/b03df-16967427088542-1920.jpg)|
